Volunteer Opportunities
</h3>
<p>
  The duties of every Sigma Phi Epsilon are to remember his Oath of Obligation; to follow the teachings of the Ritual; to uphold Virtue, Diligence, and Brotherly Love for the betterment of himself and his brothers that our lives may bring everlasting glory to Sigma Phi Epsilon. Fulfill these duties in your daily life, and you will find your fraternal experience to be rich and rewarding for both you and your brothers."
</p>
<p>
  The role of the alumnus and volunteer should be that of selfless service and often requires personal sacrifice. This role is not one of exploitation and self-gratification to the detriment of the undergraduate chapter and its membership, but one of mutual benefit, great reward, and self satisfaction.
