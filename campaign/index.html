<div id="campaign">
<p>
  Alumni contributions are at the heart of everything we do. Our communications, events, and support for the chapter all rely on gifts to the AVC. As alumni, we play a critical role in making sure our red door always stays open. We count on you and all alumni to fulfill the promise of lifelong brotherhood.
</p>
<p>
  Your support allows us to maintain our website, publish our newsletter, organize alumni events such as Homecoming and Spring Alumni Weekend, to purchase much needed supplies for chapter, and to support the chapter (both undergraduate and alumni) throughout their endeavors.

     In association with alumni and other generous donors, we are working to preserve Ryan's memory by helping Delta Sigma Pi - Nu Chi Chapter fund the Ryan Hale Scholarship. The scholarship is awarded to an individual who embodies Ryan's spirit and desire to learn at  Lynchburg College.

    Please click below to donate via credit card or send an email to <a href="mailto:AVC@SigEpVAOAlumni.org">AVC@SigEpVAOAlumni.org</a> for information about donating via check. Regretfully, contributions to the AVC are not yet tax deductible. We are in the process of making the appropriate filings to make the scholarships tax deductible. Once this process is complete, we will update this page to inform you of the change. Thank you for your patience as the AVC grows.
